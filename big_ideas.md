Dedicated to listing out in brief (or maybe not so brief...) ideas from interesting texts.

*The History of Sexuality: An Introduction*, Volume 1. Michel Foucault.
- It may seem upon immediate appearance that discourse on sexuality and sexual practice has been repressed into silence recently. However, we see instead a great explosino of discourse on sexuality - but such discourse has been molded differently, in ways in which we may not even recognize as sexual discursivity. The arrangement of bathrooms, families, education, and such are all sexual matters. That we would believe the former is itself an interesting ideological-epistemological-perceptory problem.

*Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek
- Rather than asserting the real as the noumenal in-and-of-itself which is phenomenally inaccessible to us (Kant's position), we should make a properly Hegelian move and transpose the untraversable gap between us and the noumenal as a key feature of the noumenal, the Absolute, the Real. The crack in understanding is a property of reality rather than of our failed epistemic bounds. Why make this move? Well, I will have to re-read to understand...
- Many claim that a rise of fake news has killed truth. Some historicist relativists claim there is no objective truth at all. The acknowledgement of different standpoints in ideological historicity is not relativist. There is a true understanding of social totality. On the other hand, the notion that truth has died suggests that truth was somehow alive and that its demise was recent. This is in fact the effect of ideological hegemony; its death (polarization) is the true dialectic, the immanent antagonism, which always underlied it all along. Those who decry polarization and the death of Truth are really decrying the Unifying Narrative, the Great Story. How can we return to truth? To make it subjectively engaged in universal emancipation.
  - There are true and false facts, but there are also true and false subjective positions.
  - Universality and partiality do not exclude each other; in fact, they need each other. Marx - truth comes from a subjectively engaged position.
- The parallax effect - when we change our perspective and the object appears differently, it is not merely our epistemic limitation but a change in the ontological status of the object itself.
- The only way for us to break out of the 'parallax gap' is through a psychoanalytic understanding of sexuality in which the means become more of an end than the end itself, and allows us to reach the Absolute, the Real. 
- Abstraction is immanent to material reality, rather than an idealist leveling. It is abstraction which animates and gives live to cold, dead matter. For instance, it is Marx's theory of commodity exchange which animates the distribution of products, commodities, money, and capital - rather than atoms moving other atoms around.
