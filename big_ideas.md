title: Big Ideas

Dedicated to listing out in brief (or maybe not so brief...) ideas from interesting texts. Arranged in no particular order. Subject to frequent update.

*Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek
- What is the Absolute? It is the unconditional, the totalizing, the thing which completely disrupts and really underlies the production of the normal. Zizek suggests that we might find the Absolute in the sexual.
- Rather than asserting the real as the noumenal in-and-of-itself which is phenomenally inaccessible to us (Kant's position), we should make a properly Hegelian move and transpose the untraversable gap between us and the noumenal as a key feature of the noumenal, the Absolute, the Real. The crack in understanding is a property of reality rather than of our failed epistemic bounds. Why make this move? Well, I will have to re-read to understand...
- Many claim that a rise of fake news has killed truth. Some historicist relativists claim there is no objective truth at all. The acknowledgement of different standpoints in ideological historicity is not relativist. There is a true understanding of social totality. On the other hand, the notion that truth has died suggests that truth was somehow alive and that its demise was recent. This is in fact the effect of ideological hegemony; its death (polarization) is the true dialectic, the immanent antagonism, which always underlied it all along. Those who decry polarization and the death of Truth are really decrying the Unifying Narrative, the Great Story. How can we return to truth? To make it subjectively engaged in universal emancipation.
  - There are true and false facts, but there are also true and false subjective positions.
  - Universality and partiality do not exclude each other; in fact, they need each other. Marx - truth comes from a subjectively engaged position.
- The parallax effect - when we change our perspective and the object appears differently, it is not merely our epistemic limitation but a change in the ontological status of the object itself.
- The only way for us to break out of the 'parallax gap' is through a psychoanalytic understanding of sexuality in which the means become more of an end than the end itself, and allows us to reach the Absolute, the Real. 
- Abstraction is immanent to material reality, rather than an idealist leveling. It is abstraction which animates and gives live to cold, dead matter. For instance, it is Marx's theory of commodity exchange which animates the distribution of products, commodities, money, and capital - rather than atoms moving other atoms around.
- Behind every ethnic cleansing is a poet.

*Of Grammatology*, Derrida.
- Does the translation 'ruin' the original? In fact the translation holds together the originality. Butler: "the derivative is the conditin of possibility of the original."
- Trace - the double movement and retroactive constitution of symbolic imposition. Formulating a new symbolic reality suggests that it was in fact there all along; that it was always already existent. Our thinking about origins is always eclipsed. "There is nothing outside the trace."
- Differance - marks the excess irreducible to any synthesis or expression of the symbolic. "The (pure) trace is differance." DIfferance "permits the articulation of signs among themselves." It is the undissolved, irresolving, unsynthesized excess, that which escapes the dialectical unity.
- A deconstruction can help us understand the excess which lies beyond present/past, speech/writing, mind/body.
- "The supplement is neither a presence nor an absence. No ontology can think its operation". There is no reference, there can be no reference, to this outside differance.
- Onto-theology - a framework of divine trace in which divine speech $$\to$$ divine word $$\to$$ the world $$\to$$ divine speech; circularity and self-justification.
- The concept of writing must exceed the comprehension of language.

*The History of Sexuality: An Introduction*, Volume 1. Michel Foucault.
- It may seem upon immediate appearance that discourse on sexuality and sexual practice has been repressed into silence recently. However, we see instead a great explosino of discourse on sexuality - but such discourse has been molded differently, in ways in which we may not even recognize as sexual discursivity. The arrangement of bathrooms, families, education, and such are all sexual matters. That we would believe the former is itself an interesting ideological-epistemological-perceptory problem.

*Simulacra & Simulation*, Jean Baudrillard.
- Simulacra - a representation without a copy. The existence of a simulacra ruptures our dichotomy of real and false. Ideological institutions primarily have a vested interest in maintaining the dichotomy between real and false; thus the 'toxic excrement' of a hyperreal civilization is that irony, parody, excess, and drama become productive institutions. 
- There are four stages of the image:
  1. It is the reflection of a profound reality;
  2. It masks and denatures a profound reality;
  3. It masks the absence of a profound reality;
  4. It has no relation to any reality whatsoever - it becomes its ‘own’ pure simulacrum
- The great irony of the crisis of nuclear war is that the crisis is illegitimate, a farse, a ploy, but a narrative whose failure to recognize its illegitimacy _is what makes it successful_. In this way the tactics of deterrence are sexuated in the Lacanian sense - completeness is accomplished by a thwarting, a subversiveness.

*Das Kapital*, Marx.
- Value is not somehow inherent or natural to a product. Rather, it is a product of human labor-power.
- Commodity fetishism - the introduction of money as a universal equivalent to all products enables a chain of exchange which obfuscates the origin of value; that is, in labor.
- Capital is not simply money, but rather money which begets money.
- If the profit gained by a manufacturer was 'fair', the manufacturer would only be compensated the value of their own labor input - which is negliglbe compared to that of the laborer. Therefore, classical political economists which attempt to understand profit solely in terms of labor fail to understand and explain capital concentration. Instead, the manufacturer compensates the laborer for their necessary labor, but the laborer produces labor-power, which provides surplus-labor. It is from the failure to compensate surplus-labor that manufacturers can reap high profits.
- The machine is constant capital; it cannot produce value. If it could produce surplus-value, the laborer's toil would be lightened; but in fact the introduction of machines increases the burden of the laborer. Moreover, mechanization decreases specialization and homogenizes labor to unspecialized raw labor input to machines. This input may occur lower down the line; the machine can distribute value over a larger number of products, but value still remains the product of the laborer.
