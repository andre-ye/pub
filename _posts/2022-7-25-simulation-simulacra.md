Review and notes on *Simulacra and Simulation*.

## The Precession of Simulacra
- It is not that the map is drawn from the territory anymore, but rather that the territory is drawn from the map
  - Deconstructive initial step: the inversion of the de-facto hierarchy of opposites - the fake and the real, the representation and the meaning, the syntactic and the semantic
- The 'liquidation' of the referential: the real in the referential exposed. The result is not a real nor a referential entity but a hyperreal.
- Recurrent relations, reflection and refraction: the hyperreal is characterized by a unique, disorienting, 'non-Euclidean' space
- The 'irreference' of an image $$\iff$$ the 'irreference' of the reference?
- Dissimulation leaves reality intact (does it, though?). Simulation produces the 'true' in 'real' ways.
- "Objectively" one cannot treat a patient who simulates illness as being ill or not ill.
  - Is this really true? Assumes a behaviorist external-observation epistemological understanding of truth.
  - **Is Baudrillard's argument here self-circular?**
- The production of symptoms - Anti-Oedipus and the capitalist production of schizophrenic tendencies
  - Can we understand the hyperreality in relationship to the anti-Oedipal mechanisms?
  - To what extent is the hyperreality contained within anti-Oedpial schizoid production?
- Resistance to the inherent deconstruction between the real and the simulated, resistance to the Deleuzian 'virtual'?
- What do we do about simulators? 'Fake' homosexuals, conscientious objectors, the madman.
- All crazy people simulate: to convincingly simulate craziness is to be crazy.
- The lack of distinction between the simulated and the real is 'the worst kind of subversion'. **Where does morality fit in here? Is Baudrillard lamenting the exposure of deconstruction? Is he a 'real' deconstructionist?**

> "the divinity that animates nature can never be represented"

> "God himself was never anything but his own simulacrum"

> "...the Jesuits, who founded their politics on the virtual disappearance of God"

- "murderers of the real" - in which ways is the real suicidal? How does it murder itself?
  - Zizek: how does transcendental reality give rise to ontic reality? How is the difference between the transcendental and the ontic transposed onto the transcendental itself?
- Simulation as opposed to representation: simulation is not exchanged for the real, but for itself.
  - Marx and exchange. How does the real function as capital which reproduces itself? And how does this result in the valuation and exchange-value of the real?
  - **The Real is capital; valued by its exchange, the transcendental for the ontic, the ontic for the transcendental, the ontic for the ontic.** This forms the Mobius strip of the real. (?)
  - It may be too early to say this, but it seems like Baudrillard is a manifold of Zizek's in *Sex and the Failed Absolute*.

*Let me try out an idea for size here.* When products enter into large-scale systems of exchange, they become commodities: their value in the labor that creates them becomes undifferentiated, reduced to a common substance. The fetishism of the commodity is that we become unaware of the undifferentiation even though it is the underlying logic of our exchange, and therefore mask the conditions of labor which reside within the commodity. The difference between the real and the fake, between the original and the copy, is a difference which [the substance of experience] as capital undifferentiates. We exchange [the substance of experience] routinely - we share stories, we talk, we engage on social media. It is a mass feeding and producing frenzy of this substance of experience. The 'real' experience which lies within is obscured, and maybe even vanishes. In this respect the real is suicidal, and the fake is suicidal, just as feudalism is suicidal.


- Representation stems from the principle of the equivalence of the sign and the real
  - "the radical negation of the sign as value"
- Successive phases of the image:
  1. It is the reflection of a profound reality;
  2. It masks and denatures a profound reality;
  3. It masks the absence of a profound reality;
  4. It has no relation to any reality whatsoever - it becomes its 'own' pure simulacrum
- Concepts of ownership, value, exchange.
- Modern Mobius religions: in stage three, the absence of the reality is part of its reality. Is this a deconstructive/simulacrum type object?
- Science never sacrifices itself, but it finds sacrifices to preserve th reality principle. It simulates its absence.
- Disneyland - a play of illusions and phantasms which serves as explicitly false to hide that it is real.
- The return to the double, to the copy which is and is not the original, which is lived without origin
- If there is no origin, then is there a telos? (Donna Haraway's titular philosophical question in *Cyborg Manifesto*)
