Review, notes, and reflections on *Hume's Problem Solved: The Optimality of Meta-Induction* by Gerhard Schurz

## "The Problem of Induction"
- Concept of an 'inductive inference' - can be used in a wide and narrow context.
  - Wide interpretation - deduction preserves guarantees through logical inference and derivation from axioms; induction is associated with necessary uncertainty and assume regularity and uniformity.
    - *Content expanding* - inductive inference, in a wide interpretation.
    - *Content preserving* - deductive inference, in a wide interpretation.
  - Narrow interpretation - a regularity or pattern present in current observations is used to derive a prediction for a future instance. 'Humean' induction.
    - The book will adopt the narrow interpretation of induction henceforth.
- Inductive prediction and inductive generalization - formulated probabilistically.
