Review, notes, and reflections on *Hume's Problem Solved: The Optimality of Meta-Induction* by Gerhard Schurz

## Table of Contents


## 1: The Problem of Induction

### 1.1: The Notion of Induction
- Concept of an 'inductive inference' - can be used in a wide and narrow context.
  - Wide interpretation - deduction preserves guarantees through logical inference and derivation from axioms; induction is associated with necessary uncertainty and assume regularity and uniformity.
    - *Content expanding* - inductive inference, in a wide interpretation.
    - *Content preserving* - deductive inference, in a wide interpretation.
  - Narrow interpretation - a regularity or pattern present in current observations is used to derive a prediction for a future instance. 'Humean' induction.
    - The book will adopt the narrow interpretation of induction henceforth.
- Inductive prediction and inductive generalization - formulated probabilistically.
- Focus of the book is justifying induction in the narrow sense - Hume's problem. This book's focus is on _optimally justifications_.
- **Separation of two problems**: justifying induction and justifying abduction. Abductive problems are more complex and goes beyond Hume's problem.

### 1.2: David Hume and the Problem of Justifying Induction
- The Englightenment intended to liberate rational thought from dogmatic prejudice.
- Hume introduced skepticism of the justifiability of induction in terms of causality (we know that event $$F$$ is regularly followed by event $$G$$ because $$F$$ causes $$G$$).
- Hume's argument:
  1. Induction cannot directly be justified by observation.
  2. Induction cannot be justified by deductive logic.
  3. Induction cannot be justified by induction, for such is circular reasoning.
  4. Reformulation in terms of probability does not aid the case of justifying induction. To believe that "most observed $$F$$s have been $$G$$s, therefore the next $$F$$ will be $$G$$" will be true in most future cases, we must infer that future probabilities can be inferred from past frequencies.
  5. There is no possible rational epistemic justification of induction, and it is rather psychological habit.

## 2: On Failed Attempts to Solve the Problem of Induction

### 2.1: Can Induction Be Avoided?
- Karl Popper: rational thought does not need inductive arguments. To test a theoretical hypothesis, one must derive empirically testable consequences through deductive means. However, this argument fails because it does not address the inductivity of determining corroboration, not to mention that the testable consequences may not be derivable through deductive means in statistical contexts.
- Epistemic induction is a subset of meta-induction. Concerns the induction of meta-hypotheses about the confirmation success of object-level hypotheses. 

### 2.2: Is Induction Rational by Definition?
- Analytic account - suggests induction is part of the meaning of the word 'rational'.
- We must derive an independent justification of induction rather than pointing towards 'common sense' to wave away problems.
- Intuitionism and cognitive relativism. We cannot ground our epistemic account on intuitionist rationality.
- We understand truth in a correspondence-theoretic but metaphysically neutral sense - the truth of a statement is understood in terms of its relationship with reality, but is not necessarily wholly outside of teh subject.
- We need a system of arguments which favor the truth of predictions in comparison to noninductive methods. Arguments must be noncircular.

### 2.3: Can Induction Be Justified by Assumptions of Uniformity?
- John Stuart Mill, Bertrand Russell - reliability of induction should be justified by the uniformity of nature.
- How do we define uniformity?
- The circularity of induction remains.
  1. Nature appears uniform because it has acted in consistent ways.
  2. Because it has appeared uniform in the past, it will continue to be uniform.
  3. Because nature has and will be uniform, it is uniform.
  4. Because nature is uniform, induction is valid.
- Norton - localized uniformity, inductive reasoning is not governed by quantifier rules but local induction. Yet domain-specific locality assumptions are still subject to circularity.

### 2.4: Can Circular Justifications of Induction Have Epistemic Value?
- Some suggest that circular justification can have epistemic value.
- Premise circular - premise is identical with conclusion.
- Rule circular - truth of the conclusion is presupposed by the underlying inference rule (e.g. rule of induction).
- Inductive justification of induction is rule circular.
- Rule-circular arguments can be used to simultaneously justify induction and anti-induction.

| Component | *Rule circular justification of induction.* | _Rule-circular justification of anti-induction._ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Premise | Past inductions have been successful. | Past anti-inductions have not been successful. |
| Therefore, | by the rule of induction: | by the rule of anti-induction: |
| Conclusion | Inductions will be successful in the future. | Anti-inductions will be successful in the future. |

- Rule-circular justifications are epistemically worthless.
- Blind trust in authority rule can be justified using rule-circular reasoning:
  1. Inference rule: if my accepted authority tells me $$P$$, I infer $$P$$ is true.
  2. Premise: My accepted authority tells me that blind trust in authority rule is reliable.
  3. Conclusion: I infer by the inference rule that blind trust in authority is reliable.
