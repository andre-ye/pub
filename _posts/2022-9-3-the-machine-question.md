Review, notes, and reflections on *The Machine Question: Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics* by David Gunkel

## Introduction
- Who deserves ethical consideration?
- Can machines be held responsible for actions that affect human beings?
- Modern philosophy associates the animal with the machine; Descartes and the animal-machine.
- Slavoj Zizek - there are no only true and false solutions, there are false questions: philosophy must make us understand how the very perception of the possibility frames or prevents its solution.

## Moral Agency
- Something is an agent iff it is capable of performing an action. 
- Daniel Dennet - intentionality. We must be able to ascribe beliefs and desires, intentional states.
- The standard account of moral agency requires an exclusive cut.
- Instrumentalist theory of technology - technologies are merely tools for serving users. Therefore it is neutral and the responsibility is that of the designer or the user.
- "Computer ethics" is always anthropocentric.
- Assigning responsibility to tools may allow humans to blame their tools.
- The concept of "human" is not immutable.
- Anthropocentrism is exclusive and even violent.
- Autonomous technology - technical devices which standard directly against the instrumentalist perspective.
- We can attempt to accomodate the concept of moral agency such that it is not specious. What is a person? What should a person be represented as? Person represents the community of moral agents.
- Moral statuses rest on ontological determinations.
