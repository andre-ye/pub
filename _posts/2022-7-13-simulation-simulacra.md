Review and notes on *Simulacra and Simulation*.

## The Precession of Simulacra
- It is not that the map is drawn from the territory anymore, but rather that the territory is drawn from the map
  - Deconstructive initial step: the inversion of the de-facto hierarchy of opposites - the fake and the real, the representation and the meaning, the syntactic and the semantic
- The 'liquidation' of the referential: the real in the referential exposed. The result is not a real nor a referential entity but a hyperreal.
- Recurrent relations, reflection and refraction: the hyperreal is characterized by a unique, disorienting, 'non-Euclidean' space
- The 'irreference' of an image $$\iff$$ the 'irreference' of the reference?
- Dissimulation leaves reality intact (does it, though?). Simulation produces the 'true' in 'real' ways.
