A review and notes on *Deconstruction* by David J. Gunkel. 

*Verdict*: A brilliantly written introduction of deconstruction, with examples, history, and lots of cautionary notes.

## Going Negative
- It is difficult to define deconstruction positively, so we begin by outlining the negative.
- Derrida is not the 'father of deconstruction'
- *Deconstruction is not negative.* Was an attempt to translate Martin Heidegger's *Destruktion* (from *Being and Time* - a "phenomenological *destruktion* of the history of ontology"). Deconstruction is not to disassemble, un-construct, take-apart. It is not negative, it is not an undoing - or at least, 'just' an undoing.
- *Deconstruction is not analysis or critique* in the sense that analysis is 'loosening'/'unraveling' and analysis follows the structuralist premise of identifying and isolating constitutencies or constitutions, or that critique is to separate, discern, cut, separate. In fact, deconstruction is concerned with the natural tendency towards the inability towards such separation.
- *Deconstruction is not a method.* A method is a 'road to knowledge' (Gasche). But deconstruction does not exist somewhere pure, external, abstract - in the same way that something like the scientific method might. Instead, deconstruction always already lies in the ideas it deconstructs.
- *Deconstruction is not just discourse analysis.* Deconstruction should not just be used to analyze discussion, statements, concepts, semantics; it must be applied to ideas on the level of institution, culture, tradition, structures.

## Deconstructing Deconstruction
- Binary opposition - prevalent in metaphyics: being/nothing, inside/outside, mind/body, male/female, self/other, light/dark, real/fake, natural/artificial, good/evil (*Beyond Good and Evil*), positive/negative, simple/complex, pure/tainted, essential/accidental, imitated/imitation.
- Structuralism - understands reality as a network of differences and oppositions.
- Binary oppositions are expedient and perhaps even 'natural' to the flow of information both on a neural and conceptual/meta-intellectual level. But they are problematic because they too restrict our view and thinking of the world. They also assert unequal power distributions. All inequality is a manifestation of discretization - white/nonwhite, elite/nonelite, educated/noneducated, bourgeoisie/proletariat, native/immigrant, in/out, inside/outside, here/there. All binary oppositions privilege one pole over the other; it resides in a natural staggering which in its default instantiation assumes this inequality.

> "Binary oppositions are not just a matter of discursive differnece; thye are the site of real social, political, and moral power."

- Poststructuralism: a field of thought which seeks to subvert and complicate but not to directly oppose - direct opposition behind already on structuralist terms - the structuralist mode.
- Deconstruction as a 'strategy' is composed of the following two key steps, given a binary opposition which is unequal in weight by 'default':
  1. *Inversion.* We begin a playful act of subversive deconstruction by considering the inversion of prioritization - to place the concept which is at the bottom by default on top, and its opposite on top by default instead on the bottom. This encourages us to begin breaking down the binary opposition.
  2. *Centering of an encompassing alternative.* We can 'round out' the deconstruction strategy by now identifying an alternative structure which does not 'resolve' the opposition in the dialectic Hegelian sense, but instead encompasses both oppositions while respecting the differences between them.
- The **Double Science** - overturning and displacement.
- The process of displacement does not introduce Hegel's nondialectical third term, which operates through the triad formula thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Deconstruction does not use the terms of dialectics.
