Review and notes on *Das Kapital* by Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels.

# Volume 1: The Process of Production of Capital

## 1. Commodities

**Key Ideas.**
- The capitalist economy functions on the basis of the commodity. (S1)
- The use value of a commodity is only realized by consumption, and only has value because the total labor power of society is in some part embedded within it. Use values are amalgams of matter and labor. (S1, S2)
- The exchange value of a commodity reflects something deeper within the essence of the commodity. (S1)
- The four forms of a commodity (S3):
  - *A. Elementary Form.* The simplest form to represent a commodity is as in exchange or relation to another commodity: $$\alpha A = \beta B$$, for two commodities $$A$$ and $$B$$ and two corresponding scaling coefficients $$\alpha, \beta$$. After all, a commodity compared to itself has no value beyond the tautologically trivial. To say $$\alpha A = \beta B$$ is not the same as $$\beta B = \alpha A$$ in this Marxist algebra. The left term occupies the *relative form*; the right occupies the *equivalent form*. $$A$$'s value is being bodily represented in terms of $$B$$. In this sense $$B$$ is a single unit which is said to be exchangeable with $$\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$$ of the relative form of a commodity. A commodity can only be in relative or equivalent form (exclusive) at any one time.
  - *B. Expanded Relative Form.* It is not necessarily just the case that we can express $$A$$ in terms of $$B$$. We can use $$A$$ as the relative to other equivalents, such as $$C, D, E, ...$$. That is, we can use many different commodities as the bodily value manifestation of $$A$.
  - *C. General Form.* We can just as easily express $$B, C, D, E, ...$$ as the relative commodity with $$A$$ as the equivalent form. Via the asymmetry of $$=$$ in Marxist algebra, this collective flip has a significant change in meaning. Rather than just suggesting a single commodity can be bodily manifested in value by every other commodity, we now assert that every possible commodity can find bodily manifestation in a single commodity. This opens up a complete world of exchange, because now multiple commodities can be mapped to the same manifestion, whereas previously in Form C a single commodity could be mapped to any one of multiple commodities. Commodity $$A$$ serves as the universal equivalent substance.
  - *D. Money form.* We replace the universal equivalent with the commodity of money.
- A commodity seems simple, but it functions in the bourgeois economy by obscuring the social labor relation within an exchange of commodities through the universal equivalent form of money. (S4).

**Section 1.** The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value
- The unit of the capitalist economy is the commodity.
- A commodity is external to us.
- Ever useful thing is comprised both of quality and quantity.
- Use value of a thing is made by its utility.
- Utility is limited by the physical properties of the commodity, and therefore is not completely abstract.
- Use value is realized only by consumption.
- Exchange values express something equal, but masks something inside it.
- When we equate two commodities through exchange-value, both of the two things must be reducible to a third. It exists in common to something both.
- If we do not consider the use values of commodities, the remaining common property is of labor.
- When we abstract the commodity, we abstract not only its use value but also the products of labor within it.
- **When commodities are exchanged, the exchange value manifests independent of the use value; yet value remains.**
- The common dissolver is value; exchange value is the only way a commodity can be expressed.
- A use value only has value because human labor is embodied in it. This labor is not of any individual laborer but the total labor power of society. Each unit of labor power is standardized.
- Power looms in England reduced the amount of labor needed to convert $$x$$ yarn into cloth by one half. The value of hand-loom weaves falls by half because the product of their one hour is one-half of the product of the *social labor* (with power looms).
- Magnitude of value is determined by socially necessary labor. Commodities which embody the same quantity of labor have the same value.
- Value varies directly with quantity and inversely with productiveness of labor.
- Things can have use-value but not value; things cannot have value but not use-values.

**Section 2.** The Two-fold Character of the Labor Embodied in Commodities
- A commodiy is a complex of use-value and exchange-value. Labor has the same two-fold character.
- Use values are only exchanged with other different use values.
- Labor is the creator of use value.
- Use values ('bodies' of commodities) are combinations of matter and labor.
  - Echoing Lockean ideas?
- All skilled labor can be reduced to a multiplication of unskilled labor.
- All commodities are equal in the right proportions.
- An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase in material wealth.
- Increased material wealth may lead to decrease in value.
- Human labor creates and forms the value of commodities and use values.

**Section 3.** The Form of Value or Exchange-Value
- Commodities reside in 'natural' form as they exist. They have a physical and a value form.
- Value only manifests in social relation of commodity to commodity.
- Commodities have the money form.
- The simplest way to express the value of a single commodity is the relation between values of two commodities.
- Relative and equivalent form. We cannot express commodities in terms of themselves; it must be expressed relatively, and presupposes the value of an equivalent. A single commodity cannot assume both relative and equivalent form
- The relative form assumes an independent expression; the equivlaent form is only realized as comparable with the relative form.
- Human labor power is not itself value; it only becomes value when embodied in an object.
  - Prostitution?
- In the equivalent position, we see nothing but value in its bodily form.

$$\text{Relative form} = \alpha \text{Equivalent form}$$

- By means of value relation, the bodily form of commodity $$B$$ becomes the value form of commodity $$A$$.Commodity $$A$$ converts $$B$$ into the substance which expresses $$A$$'s value. $$A$$ has taken the form of relative value.
- The relative value of a commodity $$A$$ rises and falls directly with the value of $$A$$, supposing that the value of $$B$$ is constant; and vice versa.
- The same change in relative value can arise from opposite causes (relative or equivalent value increases/decreases in opposite directions)
- When a commodity is said to be in equivalent form, it serves the purpose of direct exchange. The value is not quantiative; it is only a definite quantity of a thing.
- When a commodity acts as an equivlaent, **no quantiative determination is expressed.**
- The equivalent expresses value as it is - an engimatic form which 'escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist, until this form, completely developed, confronts him in the shape of money.'
- Concrete labor becomes the form under which abstract labor manifests itself through the equivalent form, and the labor of private individuals maniests itself as directly social labor.
- Aristotle attempted to reconcile exchange in the absence of a value concept. There is, say, no common unit which directly allows for the equating of five beds and one house. Marx proposes this common substance is human labor.
- Elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the expression relating the value relation to a different commodity
- The value of a commodity obtains independence via manifestation by manifesting as exchange-value.
- Marx now goes and revises: a commodity is not both a use value and an exchange value. A commodity is a use value and a value, which together assumes the form of exchange value.
- - **The commodity whose value a commodity is expressed is use-value; the commodity in which the value is expressed is exchange-value.**
- A product becomes a commodity when labor is expressed as one of the qualities of the product - i.e. its value.
- Every elementary relative value form of a commodity correpsonds to the single equivalent form of another commodity.
- **It is not the exchange proportions of commodites which regulates the magnitude of value, but vice versa.**
- Expanded relative form will be infinite and interminable.
- All commodites express their value in an elementary form and with unity. The general form of value: the entire world of commodities is represented with the equivalent of a single commodity.
- The elementary and expanded value forms express the value of each commodity in terms of a single commodity of a different kind. The general form brings commodites into relation with each other as values, manifesting as exchange values. A single commodity plays the role of the equivalent, and becomes exchangeable with all other commodities.
- Existence of commodities as values is purely social. In the world of commodities, the character possessed by all labor constitutes a particular social character.
- The development of the equivalent form is the result of the development of the relative form.
- 'Antagonism' between relative form of value and equivalent form of value.
- Only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value
- In the general form of value, the universal equivalent form can be assumed by any commodity. A socially identified commodity becomes the money commodity. There is no difference functionally between the general form and the money form, except the money is explicitly identified as the universal equivalent form in the money-form.

**Section 4.**  The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret Thereof
- A commodity appears easily understood, but in fact it is lived very in a very queer way. 
- A commodity is easily understood from the perspective of demand: it satisfies human wants.
- A commodity is something transcendent, beyond its mere physical form.
- The mystery of the commodity is such: the social relations between producers is epresents as a relation between products. The social relation exists not beteen producers but products of labor.
- Fetishism of products of labor: the social qualities of the commodity become obscured, unpercievable.
- Only by being exchanged is there one uniform social condition which emerges. When we exchange products, we equate different ofrms of labor as a homogenous unit of human labor, even though we are not aware of it.
- The establisment of money leads to characters as values; money form conceals the social character of private labor, and social relations between producers.
- It is clearly absurd to compare coats with linen. But we can conceal the absurdity of this labor relation with a universal equivalent. 
- The key mystery of the commodity comes fom its obscuring of the social character of the commodity and the labor within it.
- Religion is replaced by a system of capital when relations of life already offer reasonable explanations for relations between other people and Nature.
- The formula of production which dominates over man instead of vice versa is natural to the brougeoisie.
- Exchange value is of interest to human consumers but is not part of the commodity. Rather, it is exchange value which is inside the comodity.

## 2. Exchange
- Commodities cannot cause resistance against man's exchange of it.
- Exchange - objects which change in private possession. People exist as representatives of owners of commodities.
- A commodity looks at every other commodity as the bodily expression of its own value.
- The owner of the commodity does not have any immediate use-value for the commodity.
- *All commodities are not use values for their owners and use values for their non-owners.**
- To the owner of a commodity, every other commodity is in equivalent form. The owned commodity is the universal equivalent.
  - This applied to every commodity owner, so no comodity acts as a single universal equivlaent.
  - Exchange before the advent of money amounts to "transacting before thinking"
- Money is the social recognition of a single universal equivalent. 
- Objects become exchangeable through the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them.
- Reciprocal alienation and interdependence is not found in common-property systmes, such as the patrirchal family
- "Although gold and silver are not by nature money, money is by Nature gold and silver"
- When an owner exchanges a commodity for money, they now possess the value-form, not the value of the commodity.
- Gold and silver are direct abstract incarnations of human labor.

## 3. Money, or the Circulation of Commodities

**Section 1.** The Measure of Values
- It will be assumed that gold is the money commodity.
- Money must be the universal measure of value.
- Money as a measure of value is given by the common substance in all commodities - labor-time.
- Does money have a  price? Money is its own equivalent (?)
- Money is a measure of value (incarnation of human labor) and the standard of price (a fixed weight of metal).
- A money unit must be stable and not subject to variation, such that it remains a standard of price. But it must be a product of labor.
- Change in the value of gold does not affect it as a standard o fprice.
- A fall in prices results only from a fall in the value of commodities, or from a rise in the value of money.
- Price is the money-name of the labor realized in a commodity.
- Price obscures all richness in a value relation.
- When a commodity's value is represented in price, it is exchanged with the money-commodity which may or may not express the real value magnitude.
- Price ceases to express value. Objects which are not commodities by themselves (conscience, honor) are capable of acquiring, through being sold, the form of commodities. Therefore, an object can have price but not value.
- The price of uncultivated land is, according to Marx, wit no value.
- The exchange of commodities: $$C - M - C$$, Commodity - Money - Commodity. The entire result, $$C \to C$$, concerns the circulation of materialized social labor.
  - $$C \to M$$. This is sale. The labor expended upon the commodity must be socially useful. The purchaser spends the amount of labor time that is on average needed to produce the product. Te price is the money-name of the social labor realized in the commodity. Because of competition among producers in the market, each commodity which is the same is sold at the same price, represented a socially fixed quantity of homogenous human labor
  - Every sale is a purchase; the conversion of a commodity into money is also the conversion of money into a commodity. Thus, $$(C \to M) \iff (M \to C)$$.
  - $$M \to C$$. This is purchase. Money depicts itslef in the bodies of all other commodities. The last metamorphasis of a commodity is the collection of first-order metamorphoses of other commodities.
- Each commodity metamorphasis circuit is linked not end-to-end but middle-to-end and end-to-middle with other commodity metamorphasis circuits; this forms the **circulation of commodities**.
- The exchange of commodities escapes bounds of indirect barter and gives rise to the circulation of the materializations of social labor.
- The circulation of commodities does not necessarily imply an equilibrium between slaes and purchases: every seller brings his buyer to market with him. A single person enacts both sale and purchase, polar opposites; yet they are separate and independent.
- If the time between $$C \to M$$ and $$M \to C$$ is too great - i.e. money-form accumulation, hoarding - the oneness of selling and buying asserts itself in the form of **crisis**.
- Value is given by the possibility of exchange.
- The circulation of material products of labor must be begun and ended with value in the form of a commodity.
- Return of money is caused by renewal of circulation; the currency of money is constituted by its constant motion away from its origin.
- Commodities are constantly being passed in the direction opposite to that of money, from non-use-values to use-values.
- Money is a means of circulation only because of the reality of the values inside commodities.
- Reciprocal displacement between commodity and money form the $$C \to M \to C$$ circulatory exchange.
- *Alienated form of the commodity* - the money form in the seller's hand. *Absolute alienated form of the commodity* - the money form which leaves the seller's form.
- Commodites infect each other with their value relations such that prices converge to representing 'true' value (i.e. comparative value)
- The quantity of the medium of circulation is deterined by the sum of the prices that have to be realiaed.
- The quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium is the sum of the prices of commodities divided by the number of moves.
- The slowing of currency reflects the isolation of the processes of use-aspects to value-aspects and value-aspects to use-aspects.
- Given the sum of the values of commodities and the average velocity of metamorphoses, the quantity of money-currncy depends on the value of the precious metal.
  - Erroneous assertion - money is without a value and prices are determined by the quantity of the circulating medium. Conventional inflation reasoning.
- The coin is prouced and regulated State, and acquires its symbolic value through State enforcement..
- Coins of the same denomination can become different in value because they are different in weight.
- The function of a coin becomes, however, independent of all value.
- Money is a symbol of value; its functional existence absorbs its material existence.

**Section 3.** Money
- Money is the commodity which functions as a measure of value.
- There is a desire to hold onto money; commodities are sold not to purchase other commodities, but to obtain the money-form.
- We have sales witout purchases: this allows for accumulation of the money-form of value in the owners of commodities.
- Money, as every commodity, does away with distinctions; and it can become the private property of individuals; money is also social power, and therefore social power can become within the possession of individuals.
- The value of a commodity measures its attraction to other elements of material wealth, and indicates the social wealth of its owner.
- To a 'barbarian' commodity owner, value is equivalent to the value-form.
- The desire for hoarding is intrisically unsatiable. Money has no bounds on efficacy from a qualitative standpoint becuase it is the universal equivalent convertible with every other commodity, but is also limited from a quantiative standpoint; this antagonism spurs the hoarder.
- Hard work, saving, and avarice are the cardinal virtues of hoarding: to seel much and buy little, to support consumption.
- With the development of circulation, the alienation of commodities (purchase?) becomes separated from the realization of their prices (sale).
- The relationship between the creditor and the debtor has been the principal class antagonism throughout history.
- The equivalence of commodities and money is no longer simultaneous.
- The seller converts the commodity into money to satisfy a want, the hoarder does so to accumulate money-fomrs, the debtor does so in order to pay; **the value-form becomes the end and aim of the sale rather than the intermediary**.
- The debtor-buyer converts money back into commodities before he has turned commodities into money.
- Practically, money does not serve as the circulating medium but the indiivudal incarnation of social labor, an independent form of existence of exchange-value, and as the universal commodity.
- Monetary crises - contradictions between money as a means and as an end.A lenghtening chain of payments develops; the use-value of commodities becomes valueless; money becomes the only wealth. The antithesis between commodities and the value-form comes to a head. 
- Money represents commodities long withdrawn from circulation but still appears to be current; commodities circulate with value-forms drifting elsewhere.
- Credit-money is derived from money as a means of payment.
- Money becomes the commodity which is the universal subject of all contracts; it serves as the means of payments beyond the circulation of commodities - rents, taxes, and so on.
- **Money as a medium of payment forces the necessity of accumulation.**
- - When money leaves its oriign sphere of circulation, it becomes the standard and is universally recognized.

## 4. The General Formula for Capital
- Circulation of commodities is the beginning place of capital.
- Capital first takes form in money. All new capital is birthed in the form of money.
- We have the transfiguration $$C \to M \to C$$, but we also have $$M \to C \to M$$. Money that circulates in the later formula is capital.
  - Personal note - *This is really profound to me*
- The $$M \to C \to M$$ circuit consists of a purchase and a sale. 
- Similarities between the two circuits
  - Both are resolvable into two antithetical phases - the sale and th epurchase.
  - Both involve a commodity and a money.
  - Both involve a buyer and a seller.
- Differences
  - In one case both the initial point and the goal are commodities; in the other, it is money.
  - The movement in one case is the intervention of money; yet in th eother it is the commodity.
  - The buyer lays out money such that, as a seller, he may recover it. Money is not *spent*; it is *advanced*.
  - The objective of C-M-C is cosumption. The objective of M-C-M is exchange-value.
- Thus emerges the difference between money and capital. Capital is money used to make more money.
- Money is not qualitative; the only difference is quantiative; and thus the exact form of the circuit is

$$M \to C \to M'; M' = M + \Delta M$$

- Here, $$\Delta M$$ is surplus-value.
- Because M-C-M' ends with money, it is now interminable; for capital must be reinvested. **Money ends the movmene tto begin it again.**
- *Selling in order to buy is a satisfaction of wants*. Buying in order to sell is different - the **unbounded** circulation of limits.
- The capitalist becomes capital personified, endowed with consciousness. Use values are not the aims of the capital; nor profit in the singular sense. It is rather the eternal process of discovering surplus value.
- Things which have value acquire the quality to add value itself.
- Value begins and ends under the form of money.
- Money and commodities are not antagonistic to each other; the capitalist knows all comodities are money.
- Capital becomes endowed with a motion of its own.

> **M-M'**, money which begets money, such is the description of Capital from the mouths of its first interpreters, the Mercentilists.

## 5. Contradictions in the General Formula for Capital
- The inversion of the order of succession permits the expansion of value in the form of surplus value.
- It is valid to asert that exchange is a transaction by which both sides gain.
- In the medium of circulation, value is a condition of circulation, not its result.
- In an exchange, there is nothing but a metamorphosis - change in the form of the commodity. The same exchange value remains int he hands of the owner of the commodity
- **Where equality exists there can be no gain.**
- Behind attempts to circulate commodities with use-value, we see a mix-up of use-value and exchange-value. The argument that surplus-values are productive - one sells what they do not need for something they do need. But what they are trading here is exchange-value (?)
- The creation of surplus-money cannot be explained by the idea that commodities are sold above or below their value, since the prices of comodities may change but the relations reain the smae.
- We cannot explai surplus-value with the existence of a class which only purchases but does not sell (e.g. a nation which requires a tribute from a producing nation and uses the tribute to purchase commodities from said producing nation).
- Circulation - either between equivalents or non-equivalents - still does not produce surplus-value; it may change the distribution of value, but not the summ total of value itslef.
- Surplus-value cannot be created by circulation. but surplus-value can also not be created outside of circulation.
- The development of the capitalist occurs both in and out of the process of circulation.


## 6. The Buying and Selling of Labor-Power
- Surplus value does not take case in money itself; money only realizes the price of the commodity; nor in the circulation of commodities. Thus it takes place in the first act M-C, in the purchase of a commodity. 
- Essential conditions to find labor-pwoer in the market as a commodity:
  - Individuals must not sell their labor power whole-sale (i.e. slavery) but rather incrementally, over a specified finite period of time.
  - The laborer must rather sell as a commodity his labor and not the products of his labor. A laborer can sell the latter if he has his own means of subsistence and raw materials.

> "ever since his first appearance on the world's stage, man always has been, and must still be a consumer, both before and while he is producing."

- To convert money into capital, the owner of money must meet with a free laborer; this laborer can dispose his labor power as a commodity and has nothing else to sell.
- Definite historical conditions are required for a product to become a commodity, and money into capital. The emergence of capital marks a new epoch in the history of social production.
- The value of labor power is determined by the labor time needed for its production and reproduction.
- The production of labor power presupposes its existence. **The labor time prerequisite for the production of labor-power is the time needed to produce means of subsistence.**
- The owner of labor power must perpetuate himself by procreation - i.e. the laborer's children.
- The value of labor power becomes the value of a definite means of subsistence.
- There is a time delay between purchase and realization of use-value in the labor-time commodity. The capitalist can utilize the use-value before it is paid (e.g. every week, month, year, etc.)
- All look to themself only - freedom, equality, property, Bentham.
- Surplus value comes from labor-power.

## 7. The Labor-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus Value

**Section 1.** The Labor Process or the Production of Use-Values.
- Labor is a process which both man and Nature participate in.
- What differentiates the labor-power of man and that of Nature is its preconception in imagination before its realization.
- Items which can be obtained simply by severing a connection to nature (fish, fruit, etc.) are gifts of Nature. The results of this severance are raw materials.
- An instrument of labor is a mechanism which the laborer serves as a conductor of his activity with respect to the subject of labor
- The labor process disappears into the product: the blacksmith's hammer swings, the farmer's picking.
- Products are not just results, but also essential conditions of labor; they are use-values, means in other labor processes.
- A machine which does not serve the purposes of labor is useless.
- The labor process under capitalist production possesses two properties:
  - The character ensures the efficiency of the work, minimizing waste and deterioration.
  - The product is the property of the capitalist and not that of the immediate producer. The capitalist owns the labor power and congeals it into the product; upon sale of the product he only parts ways with the use-value. He has already the value.

**Section 2.** The Production of Surplus-Value.
- The product used by the capitalist is a use-value, but they are produced only in that they are repositories of exchange-values.
- The aim is to produce a value which has surplus value.
- The value of the means of production are constituencies of the value of the product.
- Two conditions:
  - Value is independent of use-value, but it most be embodied in a use-value.
  - Time occupied in the labor of production must not exceed the socially necessary time.
- The value which labor power creates and the value o flabor power are different in magnitude; and the capitalist aims at the difference between the two. The laborer realizes its exchange value and parts with its use value, just as with any commodity. The buyer of the labor-power owns its use value now.
- Equivalent is exchanged for equivalent, but surplus labor originates from teh excess in labor.
- It does not matter whether labor appropriated by the capitalist is skilled or unskilled. Moreover, the reduction of skilled labor to average labor is unavoidable.

## 8. Constant Capital and Variable Capital
- Labor adds fresh value by expending additional labor.
- Labor raises the means of production from the dead by making them living factors of the labor process.
- Labor both produces and preserves value.
- The total value of the means of production are gradually transferred to the products, given that their use-value deteriorates.
- The property that the laborer retains value while adding value to it is a gift of Nature and costs the laborer nothing but is of tremendous help to the capitalist.
- The action of labor power not only reproduces its own value, but produces value over this base.
- The part of capital which constitutes the means of production is constant capital. The part represented by labor-power is variable: this undergoes the alteration of value. It produces the equivalent of its own value and an excess surplus value, which can vary.
- 

## 9. The Rate of Surplus Value

**Section 1.** The Degree of Exploitation of Labor-Power

- Let $$C$$ represent capital; it consists of the money $$c$$ laid into the means of production and the sum of money $$v$$ expended upon labor power. Thus $$C = c + v$$. Let the surplus value be $$s$$. Thus the resulting sum is $$C = c + v + s$$.
- $$v$$ relates to $$s$$; the dead labor is animated into living labor, variable labor.
- One can calculate the absolute production of surplus value by setting $$c = 0$$. 
- The relative production of surplus value is given by $$\frac{s}{v}$$ - this is the rate of surplus value.
- Necessary labor-time: the labor-time required for the reproduction of wages in expended labor. Necessary labor: the labor expended in necessary labor-time.
- When a laborer's labor is no longer necessary, it becomes surplus labor and has the effect of 'creating out of nothing'. 
- The rate of surplus value expresses the ratio between surplus labor and necessary labor. This is the degree of exploitation of labor-power.

**Section 2.** The Representation of the Components of the Value of the Product by Corresponding Proportional Parts of the Product Itself

Various component parts of the value of the product can be represented as proportional parts of the product itself. The product is a result of a chain of labor applied to the natural gifts of labor, and thus we can identify how constitutencies of value manifest in physicalities of the product.

One may perceive the worker as laboring to account for the reproduction of all the machinery and also to produce surplus value.

**Section 3.** Senior's Last Hour
- Nassau Senior - the whole profit is derived from the last hour. Thus decreasing the length of the workday threatens not just surplus profit but gross profit.
- Marx - but we are not reproducing all of the value in the single hour. The value was already congealed within the object, and one hour of time was added to it. There is nothing mystical about it.

**Section 4.** Surplus-Produce
- SUrplus-produce - the part of the product that represents the surplus-value.
- A nation's wealth should be measured by the relative magnitude of surplus-produce.
- Sum of necessary labor and surplus labor constitutes the time which is worked, i.e. the working day.

## 10. The Working Day

**Section 1.** The Limits of the Working Day
- The working day is not constant; it is variable.
- There are, however, limitations on the working day - the ratio between surplus labor and necessary labor must be near zero at minimum and labor in total cannot exceed 24 hours a day.
- What is now the outermost limit?
- Capital is dead labor, vampire like - capital has 'one single life impulse' - to create surplus value
- The bounds of the normal working day are exceedingly elastic.

**Section 2.** The Greed for Surplus-Labor - Manufacturer and Boyard
- Capital is not the inventor or sustainer of surplus labor; any sector of society which holds monopoly over the means of production must use surplus labor.
- However, it is in capital in which the bounds on the quantity of surplus labor are raised to physical limits.
- In many cases, with the corvee system, the working day is longer than the material day.
- Progressive 'small thefts' of capital
- The worker becomes understood as labor-time

**Section 4.** Day and Night - the Relay System
- Constant capital only absorbs labor; variable capital translates it into surplus labor
- Because it is impossible to fully use labor throughout day and night, a relay system emerges
- Thus the machine can spin 24 hours a day and extract more surplus labor than physically in a day.

**Section 5-7.** The Struggle for a Normal Working Day
- David Harvey - the first occurrence of class conflict in *Capital*
- The laborer is always nothing else than their labor power
- Capital does not care for the length of life of labor power - it is a 'greedy algorithm'
- Capitalist production therefore produces the deterioration of human-labor power and the premature exhaustion of labor-power.
- In slavery, there is some care for the slave's health
- The population of laborers degenerates and becomes stunted; yet capital invents its own responses (profit and the good it brings)
- Free competition brings out the laws of capitalist production -- coercive laws -- and therefore the will or morality of the capitalist is irrelevant.
- The working day is a result of centuries of struggle between capitalist and laborer.
- Capital keeps on pushing the working day longer and longer - "capital celebrated its orgies"
- Capitalism redefined day and night, age, childhood, temporality.
- Legislation may impose limits but capital always skirts around
- Capital has an unrestricted passion for lenghtening the working day.
- A labor as a 'free' agent of their labor succumbs to capitalist production.
- "Labor cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded." Yet out of the Civil War emerges the agitation for 8 hours.
- For protection against exploitation, the worker must emerge as a class.

## 11. The Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value
- We have henceforth considered the value of labor power as in given, constant magnitudes.
- The magnitude of variable capital varies with the number of workers
- The mass of surplus value created is a combination of the number of workers and the degree of exploitation of each worker.
- Let $$S=$$ mass of surplus-value, $$s=$$ the surplus-value given by an individual laborer on an average day, $$v=$$ the variable capital spent daily, $$V=$$ the sum total of variable capital, $$P=$$ the value of an average labor-power, $$\frac{a'}{a}$$ the degree of exploitation. We can calculate the mass of surplus value as follows:

$$S = \frac{s}{v} \cdot V + P \times \frac{a'}{a} \times n$$

- The absolute limit on the average working day sets a limit on how small a workforce can be.
- Thus capital tends to increase as many laborers as possible.
- The mass of the surplus-value produced is determined by the rate of surplus-value and the amount of variable capital advanced.
- The capitalist divides capital into constant parts (means of production) and variable parts (labor-power).
- We find that surplus value is maximized by variable capital. This is contradictory because variable capital should compensate constant capital (e.g. the spinner and the baker).
- **Interesting** - "0/0 may represent an actual magnitude"
- Social working day - total number of hours worked.
- The capitalist must have an initial principal capital amount, larger than the value of labor power. A laborer which does not have this amount must turn to work. Sometimes, the surplus value extracted is not enough and the capitalist must work himself, thus he is a hybrid capitalist laborer. But at a certain evolution in society, the capitalist must dedicate all his time to surplus-value creation.
- The capitalist is personified capital: ensures the labor process proceeds efficiently.
- Capital coerces the working class to perform more work than is 'needed' for self-sustenance.
- The production of surplus value through extension of the working day **is independent of change in the mode of production**.
- When we consider the process of production from the perspective of optimizing surplus value, it *becomes the means of production which work the laborer, not the laborer which works the means of production*. This is a deconstructive step, an inversion - the likes of Derrida and Baudrillard. It is the means of production which *consumes* the laborer, the laborer becomes embedded into the product.

## 12. Concept of Relative Surplus-Value
- The laborer continues to work past the value of what he is paid for.
- How can the production of surplus be increased without increasing the working day? By somehow lenghthening the period of surplus labor and simultaneously neccessarily contracting the period of necessary labor.
- The capitalist can pay the laborer less, and thus the reproduction of necessary labor becomes shorter in labor-time. Yet then the laborer's labor-power is diminished because the laborer fails to sustain their own life.
- Therefore we cannot decrease the labor-time spent reproducing by reducing the wage for the value of the laborer's labor-power, but *by reducing the value itself*.
- Surplus value produced by prolonging the working day - absolute surplus value.
- Surplus value produced by changing the ratios of surplus to necessary labor-time in the working day - relative surplus-value.
- Increasing the productivity of labor in industries which supply the necessities of life decreases the value of labor-power. 
- A scientific analysis of competition is not possible.
- The real value is not measured by labor-time but socially necessary labor time. Therefore extra-surplus value is realized by increasing labor-efficiency such that the individual value is below the social value, and the differential between individual value and social value is pocketed as exrta surplus-value. Thus it is the incentive of the capitalist to cheapen commodities by increasing the productiveness of labor.
- As soon as an efficient method of production becomes general, the difference between the individual and social values of a product ceases to exist and surplus-value falls.
- A commodity's value is inversely related to the productiveness of labor, but relaitve-surplus value is directly related to it.
- The capitalist has no interest in the commodity's value. What is important is the surplus-value.
- Why does the capitalist continually decrease the social value of commodities?
