Review and notes on *The Case Against Death* by Ingemar Patrick Linden.

## 1. The Case Against Death
- Is it bad to die, or is death a good, fitting end after a long life?
- We are scientifically moving towards a point where we can significantly prolong life, although we are certainly not there yet.
- Many people believe that death is fine, or even good.
- Many resist the idea that it is god to be alive and that it is bad to die.
- Is it countercultural to suggest that it is bad to age and die?
- Apologism - an acceptance of death deeply embedded into our culture. Contrast with prolongevism.
- Most important philosophers taught that we should not fear death - Socrates, the Buddha, the Stoics, Montaigne, Epicureans, 
- Apologism is dominant in science fiction, cultural art, bioethics, 
- Linden argues the Wise Apologist View is false.
- Each individual believe themselves to be wiser than most people.
- We say we subscribe to the Wise View, but we invest much in our youth.
- Belief in an afterlife can be denialism or prolongevitism.
- Fear of decrepitude can explain only some of the attraction of the Wise View.
- Preference adaptation: we avoid frustration by only wanting what we have.
- The wise view is fragile.
