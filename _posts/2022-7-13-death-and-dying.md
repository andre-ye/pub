Review and notes on *Death and Dying* by Nicole Piemonte and Shawn Abreu, MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series.

- When is life still worth living?
- Does everyone have the right to determine how they want to die, in parchment and in practice?
- Modern medicine's conception of death is as failure: this metric is the primary shaper of end-of-life default practices.
  - It is more unconscionable to let a patient which wanted to live to die than to let a patient which wanted to die to live.
  - Is this right? Would a visible deconstruction of life and death be informative here?
