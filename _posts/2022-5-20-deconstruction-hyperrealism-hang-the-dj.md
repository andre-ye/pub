Black Mirror's "Hang the DJ" has, like so many well-produced literary texts, a very high complexity ceiling. The almost one-hour long episode features a world in which individuals are forced together and apart by an omniscent intelligent system promising to eventually pair each individual with their optimal romantic interest. Two individuals, Frank and Amy, grow close but are forced apart by the system; as their bodies are plunged in and out - both metaphorically and sexually - of other bodies with numbing repetity, they become detatched and existentially exhausted. When they are given a chance to briefly reunite, they decide to rebel against the system. When they do so, their bodies disintegrate into a fluid, abstract, artistically 'virtual' space that itself warps into a dating app interface. The jaunty music playing in the bar - "Hang the DJ" - informs us that we are in a viscerally different world. We see Amy and Frank, who have been matched to each other on the dating app, looking at each other shyly across the bar.

There are many questions to engage with in this episode, but perhaps the most pressing is the relationship between the simulated and the real. I argue that the episode principally sets forth a *philosophical* position: that the simulated is more real than we give it credit for, and - consequently - that the real is more simulated than we would like to believe. Ultimately, the real and the simulated are concepts that, when separated in the intrinsic, destabilize each other in an antagonistic dichotomy that forces us to consider their inevitable intermeshing. In application, we understand that simulated representations of 'real people' - Jean Baudrillard's concept of the *simulacra*, or more accessible and disseminatable representations of objects of significance, like small figurines of Jesus or Disneyland memorabelia - that interact with each other are, in a very palpable sense, interactions between real people. Recommender systems that represent individuals with vectors and latent properties (the quantified simulacra), like the dating apps featurs in "Hang the DJ", manipulate and match simulacra in ways so densely interconnected with the 'real' world that we must understand the simulated as real and the real as simulated.

To make sense of such abstract arguments, we can develop a concrete calculus which is temporarily useful (but will eventually cave in upon itself). Let $$C$$ be an object in and of itself, the thing 'in the flesh', the thing 'itself', the 'real' thing. Let $$C' := {C'_0, C'_1, ..., C'_{n-1}} $$ be a set of representations/simulacrum of $$C$$. For instance, let $$C$$ be an individual. $$C$$ is looking for love, so $$C$$ ventures into the online dating world. By participating on the online dating app, $$C$$ continually contributes to his set of simulacra $$C'$$. Let $$X$$ represent some other object in and of itself, and correspondingly $$X' := {X'_0, X'_1, ..., X'_{n-1}$$ its set of simulacrum. It should be clear that $$C$$ and $$X$$ can meet, in the flesh (e.g. $$C$$ has dinner with $$X$$). 

 In this sense, we understand a primary antagonism: the real thing in and of itself, 'in the flesh', and the representation/simulacrum of the thing in and of itself.

Reality and simulation have become antagonistic binaries that destabilize each other.

To be continued.
