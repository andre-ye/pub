Black Mirror's "Hang the DJ" has, like so many well-produced literary texts, a very high complexity ceiling. The almost one-hour long episode features a world in which individuals are forced together and apart by an omniscent intelligent system promising to eventually pair each individual with their optimal romantic interest. Two individuals, Frank and Amy, grow close but are forced apart by the system; as their bodies are plunged in and out - both metaphorically and sexually - of other bodies with numbing repetity, they become detatched and existentially exhausted. When they are given a chance to briefly reunite, they decide to rebel against the system. When they do so, their bodies disintegrate into a fluid, abstract, artistically 'virtual' space that itself warps into a dating app interface. The jaunty music playing in the bar - "Hang the DJ" - informs us that we are in a viscerally different world. We see Amy and Frank, who have been matched to each other on the dating app, looking at each other shyly across the bar.
