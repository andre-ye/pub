Review and notes on *Phonemenology* by NChad Engelland, MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series.

> Phenomenology enhances perception so we perceive all that is important in wha seems small.

## 1. To the Things Themselves
- Phenomenology is the experience of experience.
- Key thinkers - Husserl, Scheler, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty.
- Phenomenology studies the true appearnance of things.
- Physicsts and scientists often venture to explain our existnece and to, in essence, dsplace philosophy; yet they leave out wonderment, questions, appearances.
- Modern science cannot locate itslef in the image it generates.
- By thoughtfully experiencing experience, we can understand the structures of experience.
