Review, notes, and reflections on *The Outer Limits of Reason: What Science, Mathematics, and Logic Cannot Tell Us* by Noson S. Yanofsky

## Language Paradoxes
- Liar paradox - I am lying. This sentence is false.
- "This sentence is false" has five words.
- "Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.
- Barber paradox - all who do not shave themsleves go to the barber, all that do shave themselves do not go to the barber; whod oes the barber go to? Self-referential.
- Homological/autological - adjectives that describe themselves. Heterological - adjectives that don't. Is heterological heterological? Heterological is only heterological iff it is not heterological.
- Reference-book paradox: a list of all reference books that do not list themsleves. Does this list list itself?
- Russell's paradox - does the set of sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?
- Yabloi's paradox: $$K_n := K_i$$ is false for all $$i > n$$. So which sentence is true and which is false? This is a contradiction without self-reference.
- All integers are interesting by contradiction - let the smallest noninteresting number be $$N$$. Therefore $$N$$ is interesting.
- Berry phrase - "the least number not expressible in fewer than eleven words".
- Richard paradox. Let phrases describing real numbers between 0 and 1 be Richard phrases. What is the Richard phrase that is different from all Richard phrases?
