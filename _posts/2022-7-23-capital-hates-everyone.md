Review and notes on *Capital Hates Everyone: Fascism or Revolution* by Maurizio Lazzarato.

## Introduction: Apocalyptic Times
- These times manifest and reveal.
- The alternative fascism or revolution is asymmetrical, off-balance.
- The neoliberal position is founded on violence. One needs not only to think about the violence that preserves, but the violence that creates.
- Fascisms are always reactivating the relationship between war and governmentality.
- One always finds class hatred and strategic violence underneath the facade of progress.
- Leninist model of revolution - *realization*. The ideal passage must be realized through power seizure.
- Recent revolutionary processes: exist 'unforseen'; do not embody history's necessity.
- **The relationsihp between production and circulation has been reversed.** The revolutionaries attack not the factories but block the roads.
- Left populism - the signifier of authority, the empty signifier of 'the people' - cannot be revolutionary. 
- Social revolution which detaches from political revolution can easily fall prey to incorporation.

## 1. When Capital Goes to War
- Elecion of Bolsonaro in Brazil: radicalization of neo-fascism, racism, sexism.
- The neoliberal birth occupied brutal positions in South America.
- The contemporary analytical tradition ignores the violent genealogy of neoliberalism. The problem is not moral but theoretical: Foucaultian concepts presuppose that the subjectivity of the ogverned can be constructed only on the conclusion of defeat.
- Neoliberalism parts from laissez-faire capitalism with constant intervention and incentivization.
- Benjamin - capital is both production of war, power of creation and destruction.
- Neoliberalism finds roots in fascism.

### The Financialization of the Poor
- Capital transforms the defeated into the governed.
- The war has never ceased; contradictions within pacified relations rupture governmentality.
- There is a radical incompatibility of reofrmism with neoliberalism.
- Transformation of the poor into the indebted.
- The creditor/debtor relation cuts across social strata and shifts the terrain of class struggle.
- The Keynesian demand - redistribution of wealth by the state should be replaced by the privatization of state expenditures and social services.
