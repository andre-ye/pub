An interesting and accessible overview of gender theory, centering around the particularly provocative claim that "gender is clear for all". Crucially explores the involvement of race and capital in the formation of gender, but could go deeper. Makes for thought-provoking reading, but in my opinion falls short of full theoretical strength. Understandable for its introductory context.
