Review, notes, and reflections on *Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications*, edited by John Danaher and Neil McArthur.

## "Should We Be Thinking About Robot Sex"
- There is a long history of artificial human sexual stimulation.
- Sex dolls have a longer history compared to sex robots, which must possess the following three qualities:
  - Humanoid form
  - Human-like movement and behavior
  - Some degree of Artificial Intelligence - interpretation and environmental adaptability
- Sex robots are novel and not fully realized technologies.
- Sex robots pose a number of interesting philosophical questions.
  - What is the personhood of a sex robot?
  - Do sex robots have 'rights'?
  - Is there a significant distinction between the concept of innate being and the being we may endow in sex robots, as members of society and/or their lovers?
    - Is a visible deconstruction between innate and imposed informative here?
  - What sociological role do sex robots fulfill?
  - Where do sex robots stand in relationship to gender theory? Are sex robots liberating or degrading?
    - Are sex robots characteristically female? To what extent are they an other gender, a mechanical gender which alludes but is and always will remain distinctly different?
    - What is the sexuality of the sex robot?
  - How will sex robots shape the future of human reproduction?
