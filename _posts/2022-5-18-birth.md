As Interactive Intelligence has grown, we have produced a signficant body of content. The purpose of I2 Pub is to provide a formal publication/site to host, publish, and disseminate content and ideas on AI, neuroscience, philosophy, and their intersections. We hope this repository of content will be thought-provoking and interesting to our readers!
