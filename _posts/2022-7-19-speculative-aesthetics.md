Review and notes on *Speculative Aesthetics*, edited by Robin Mackay, Luke Pendrell, and James Trafford.

## Introduction
- Speculative realism - perhaps moves away from the primacy of intuition adn interpretation, and therefore is anti-aesthetic?
- SR art: levels the artistic witha  nonartistic universe. 
- Artwork is a thing, in existence with other things. 
- SR realizes art after philosophy: vacuously general concepts can transform *things* - *stuff* - into an aesthetically and philosophically significant experience.
- Speculative aesthetics must refuse to create additional materials. It must focus on the structure.
- Aesthesophobia'
- Contemporary political art seeks both to subvert the political status quo while itself being a product of these very forces.
- 'Undo the imag eot undo power'
- Speculation treads between naive realism and ruinous ontological speculation.
- Contemporary art erodes the agency of the image.
- 'Real abstractions'
- Speculative aesthetics rethinks cognition in the collective.
