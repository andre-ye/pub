Review and notes on *Aesthetics Equals Politics: New Discourses Across Art, Architecture, and Philosophy.*

## Politics Equals Aesthetics: Jacques Ranciere and Mark Foster Gage
- Aesthetics as more than a theory of art, but about the constitution of *sensibility* in experience. How do we experience the 'common world'? - how do we hold experiences and images in common; how do we share, distribute, disseminate, transfigure, disfigure, modify, copy, replicate, duplicate, remix these?
- Politics is aesthetic: it was aesthetic before art. Politics is dominated by the argument over which experiences should be designated by which audiences and how these experiences can be restricted, spread, modified, shared.
- Social revolution is the daughter of aesthetic revolution. 
- An aesthetic experience is **the reattribution of the sensible**.
- The aesthetic experience in relationship to temporality: *taking time which the laborer does not have*, emancipation.
- Standpoint epistemology - how does the distribution of the sensible manifest as a function of what we do and what we experience? In this sense, the aesthetic transfigures and disfigures itself.
- Does aesthetics generate equality or hierarchical differentiation?
- Althusser's problem: where is the one who presents a grand theory of ideology situated in ideology? Althusser's solution: the Wise One is situated somehow outside of ideology ('seen the light' - beckons the cynical interpretation of ideology as totalizing, Baudrillard-style) and leads the indoctrinated masses towards seeing beyond ideology. Williams' solution: from cultural materialism, certain ideas capture a common *structure of feeling* which is irrepressible by nature of oppressive conditions of existence, and they escape incorporation and accumulate into substantive change. How does the aesthetic play this dynamic?
- 'Inactive activity', 'active inactivity' - disturbing the traditional distribution of activities and capacities
- How is space distributed in the modern sense? What is aesthetic about political acts such as Occupy Wall Street? Suppression of segregation of spaces; subverting the circulation of bodies throughout space. Standing Tank Man - occupation of space by doing nothing. (Additionally - Bartleby in Melville's *Bartleby, the Scrivener*.)
  - Can architecture similarly engage in political subversion of space? Ranciere suggests such is not the point.
- Raising awareness doesn't require action; it is not critical intervention.
  - Is this valid or fair? Is there really a fundamental difference between the notion of a 'critical intervention' and a real 'awareness' in an Althusserian analysis of visibility within ideological systems?
