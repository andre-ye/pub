Review and notes on *Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek

## Introduction: The Unorientable Space of Dialectical Materialism
- When belief in an Absolute fails, a hedonistic pseudo-Absolute is instantiated in its place.
- Sexuality is inconsistent, and this its evalation into the new Absolute fails.
- Schelling: the female orgasm is the high point of human evolution.
- Sloterdijk: the experience of the orgasm is ontological proof of god - we come into closest contact with teh Absolute.
- Intense sexual act as the most intense unity of Being is wrong; we need to focus on how sexuality is constituted by antagonisms.
- This book - concerned with exploring large metaphysical questions without regressing to premodern sexualized understandings.
- Topology - a structure which is unorientable has no consistent definitions of direction.
  - Mobius strip
  - Cross cap
  - Klein bottle
- **The theoretical space of dialectical materialism is unorientable**; it caves in upon itself.
  - Language here is reminiscent of Baudrillard's quasi-topological descriptions of the curvature and shape of the hyperreal.
- Why refer to dialectical materialism? An unorientable dialectical materialism is very different from Stalin's DM.
  - Hegel - change takes place when we notice it has already taken place
  - Progress is always localized; we observe circularity generally
- *Ontological parallax*. Parallax - the displacement of an object caused by a change in observational position. Philosophical: the observed difference is not simply subjective; subject and object are mediated, such that an epistemological shift in the subject's view always results in an ontological shift in the object itself.
  - Similar to Heidegger's *ontological difference*; the ontological dimension cannot be collapsed into the ontic singular.
- Unorientables enables us to investigate what materialism really is.
  - We need to disassociate materialism with matter; but rather materialism without matter, in the material of waves and quanta in a dematerialized space.
- True materialism implies the disappearance of matter in a network of relations. The movmeent of the abstract immaterial should be conevied as entirely contingent, purposeless, and non-spiritual.

> "ideas are stupid, a mind embodied in a 'material' living being is needed to combine them in a purposeful way."

- Materialism should be deprived of evolutionary progressivism or determinism; evolutionary materialism is the 'worst idealism'.
- Evolutionary optimism is simply not true.
- A dialectical analysis helps us detect subterranean tensions and invert///subvert the continuity of progress.
- Dialectical materialism: **depth is an effect of convoluted surface*.
- Theorems of the book.
  1. We should not be tempted by new materialist ontologies; every ontology fails and reality thwarts itself, this subversion understood in the parallax gap between the ontic and the transcendental.
  2. One can step behind the parallax gap by transposing it onto the thing itself; this redoubling happens in the place of sexuality as our contact with the Absolute. Sexuality is the force of negativity which disrupts every ontological platform.
  3. Explores the convoluted topology of reality.
  4. The negative which grounds our reason cannot be taken into account by realist ontoloiges; the dimneison of subjectivity is irreducible.
- The enemy of this book is not new realist ontologis but alluring non-thinking.

## Theorem I: The Parallax of Ontology

> Not only our experinece of reality, but also this reality itself is traversed by a parallax gap: the co-existence of two dimensions, realist and transcendental, which cannot be united in the same global ontological edifice.

- Absolute Knowing - Hegel's version of contact with the Absolute

### Modalities of the Absolute
- Can humans contact the Absolute?
- Scale: Absolute as ultimate substantial reality $$\iff$$ Absolute as pure appearance
- Beauty is an Absolute - there is more truth in appearance than what is hidden behind it. (Baudrillard, *Simulacra and Simulation*)
- Plato and Christianity are anti-Wisdom; the Absolute appears in fleeting experiences rather than modernist depths-beneath-the-surfaces.
- The Absolute is easily corroded.
- German idealism - subject and object coincide. 
- Materialist Marxist - social totality of practice is the ultimate horizon of determining meaning.
  - The Nazis were not wrong because it presents Jews in the wrong light, but is 'absolutely' false becuase it obfuscates the antagonism of the social totality by projecting an internal cause onto an external intruder. Historical materialists reject the possibility of objective self-views.
- The solution to what separates us from the Absolute is not to overcome the gap but to transpose the difference onto the Absolute.
  - Disparity between subject and object is simultaneously the disparity of the object with itself.
  - The epistemological ignorance of the subject is also the epistemological ignorance of the object.
  - Christianity: the alienation of man from god is projected onto god itself. (Christ falls from God: "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"; god is abandoned by himself.)
- Christian Marxism - Marxism without Christianity is too idealist; only a link to Christianity makes Marxism truly materialist.
- **Absolute Knowing** - the violent twist through which we realize that our ignorance is at the same instant the ignorance in the Other itself.**
- If objective reality is all there is, how should it be structured so subjectivity emerges out of it? how can we reconcile the ontic and transcendental realities?
- How can we describe the pre-ontic and pre-ontological structure of objective reality, which comes through transcendental constitution? We must describe the things which are 'less than nothing'
- Hegel's absolute recoil: a substantial entity emerges through recoil; a retroactive effect of its divisions. 
  - Words retroactively create the silence it disturbs.
- Bootstrapping - pulling one up by one's hair - is impossible, but it is the feature which defines spirit; there is no spirit without matter.
- **We cannot say that our reality is an imperfect approximation of a full spirital entity** because this failure  of realizing spirit is intrinsic to the material domain: spirit emerges through the failure of the material domain to fully render it.
- Meillassoux - transposes the contingency of our perception of reality into reality; this is subtly different from redoubled lack. It is caught in the middle; the problem appears retroactively as its own solution. Asserts the cognitive accessibility of reality in itself. Facticity is a basic ontological feature of reality itself.
- Hegel overcomes Kant's agnosticism; Kant's epistemological limitation is ransposed onto ontological impossibility; things in themselves are marked by ontological incompleteness.
- Meillassoux - primary properties must be capable of being formalized in mathematical terms conceived as properties of the object in itself; mathematics becomes the syntax of objective ontology. Builds the difference into the ontology of reality.
- What if we do not ontologize the negative, but instead conceive of a subvrsion of every ontology such that every conception of an objective reality becomes irreducibly normative? The only non-normative fact is he gap of impossibility itself.

## Reality and its Transcendental Supplement
- Philosophy switches between the transcendental (what is the universal structure of reality's appearance?) and the ontic (what is the universe itself?).
- Heidegger was the 'climax without decline' of transcendentalism; the natural sciences 'kidnapped' the ontic.
- Hawking declared that philosophy was dead. However science is wrapped in the hermeneutic circle; the space it discovers is constrained by itself. It is itself a philosophical system.
- Reality deprived of the transcendental is inconsistent. Consider the nuclear button; a tiny part of reality which holds it all together.
- Scientific realism is the contemporary hegemonic view.
- How does the transcendental dimension arise in the real (ontic)?
- Deontological dimension: the ought/is differentiation
