Review and notes on *Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek

## Introduction: The UNorientable Space of Dialectical Materialism
- When belief in an Absolute fails, a hedonistic pseudo-Absolute is instantiated in its place.
- Sexuality is inconsistent, and this its evalation into the new Absolute fails.
- Schelling: the female orgasm is the high point of human evolution.
- Sloterdijk: the experience of the orgasm is ontological proof of god - we come into closest contact with teh Absolute.
- Intense sexual act as the most intense unity of Being is wrong; we need to focus on how sexuality is constituted by antagonisms.
- This book - concerned with exploring large metaphysical questions without regressing to premodern sexualized understandings.
- Topology - a structure which is unorientable has no consistent definitions of direction.
  - Mobius strip
  - Cross cap
  - Klein bottle
- **The theoretical space of dialectical materialism is unorientable**; it caves in upon itself.
  - Language here is reminiscent of Baudrillard's quasi-topological descriptions of the curvature and shape of the hyperreal.
- Why refer to dialectical materialism? An unorientable dialectical materialism is very different from Stalin's DM.
  - Hegel - change takes place when we notice it has already taken place
  - Progress is always localized; we observe circularity generally
- *Ontological parallax*. Parallax - the displacement of an object caused by a change in observational position. Philosophical: the observed difference is not simply subjective; subject and object are mediated, such that an epistemological shift in the subject's view always results in an ontological shift in the object itself.
  - Similar to Heidegger's *ontological difference*; the ontological dimension cannot be collapsed into the ontic singular.
