Review and notes on *The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness is Widespread but Can't be Computed*, by Christof Koch.

## 1. What is Consciousness?
- Straightforward understanding - consciosuness is experience.
- Decartes - I think, therefore I am. Experiencing is the basis of being.
- Consciousness is prior to physics.
- Assertion: any experience is structured. Saussurean/structuralist approach to the textual nature of reality.
- An experience is informative, integrated, and definite; it has a point of viw and occurs in time.

## 2. Who is Conscious?
- Abductive reasoning - extrapolate backwards to infer hypotheses that fit the given data best.
- Psychologists can quantify phenomenology under laboratory conditions.
- Perception is an active process: construction of useful features.
- Phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness: what you experience and what you can report

### 3. Animal Consciousness
